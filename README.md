<b>What's Different?</b> <br>
- added space for community college (proud community college, non-trad --> PhD Student here)
- changed "Publications" to "Peer-Reviewed Research" and divided into "Journal Publications" and "Conference Activity."  
"Conference Activity" includes peer-reviewed conference papers and peer-reviewd panel proposal content that were accepted for presentation.
- "Awards, Fellowships, and Grants" was divided into subsections "Awards & Honors" and "Fellowships and Grants." This is following the guidance of 
other scholars in my discipline who have done so. This will likely get modified in the future to include grant-specific information, as needed
- Modified "Professional Experience" to "Research Experience." This information didn't really seem to work with /cvhonor so I switched it to /cventry instead.
I'm not *in love* with it, but haven't really thought about what I'm going to do instead (Plus, annual review deadline is next week, so don't really have time
to play around with formatting. In short, this is bound to change.)
- "Presentations" was modified to "Public Scholarship" and added \cvsubsection for "Educational Tour, Lectures and Workshops," "Invited Presentations," 
and "Trade Publications and Alternative Press." Public scholarship and community-engaged work is a key part of my approach to academic work and just life.
- \cvsubsection for "Service to Discipline," institutionally divided service to department, college and university, and non-profits and publics were added as well.

<br>
Again, service and being an active and participatory member of the communities where I live, work, and research is a key part of my identity, and probably 
closely tied to being a qualitative social scientist with a desire to develop my skills as a critical ethnographer. This may not be your jam (that's cool) or
it may not be relevant to your field. Hopefully laying out what I did will help you get what you need out of it.

Enjoy! <br>
